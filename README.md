## How to Play

1. The game selects a random 5-letter word
2. You have 6 attempts to guess the word
3. After each guess, you'll see indicators for each letter:
   - ■ (filled square) means the letter is in the correct position
   - □ (empty square) means the letter is in the word but in the wrong position
   - × means the letter is not in the word
4. Use the on-screen keyboard or your Kindle's keyboard to enter guesses
5. Press "Enter" to submit a guess
6. Try to guess the word in as few attempts as possible!

- Optimized for Kindle's screen size and black & white display
- Includes polyfills for older browsers

## Adding new languages

In order to add a new language, you need 2 lists: the guessing word list and the accepted word list. The second one is usually much longer, as it should contain all 5 letter words of the language. The guessing list contains a good collection of usual words. The 2 lists can be the same.

If the language contains accented characters (like "é", "ç" etc.), replace them with the non-accented variants ("e", "c" etc.)

Arrange the 2 lists in the following format:
```
["word1","word2","word3"],
```

Copy the lists in the `words.js` file, at the declaration of the `wordList` and `accepted` variables (just before the `];` lines).

Then add the language at the end of the `languageList` variable (`main.js` line 15).

Don't forget to add the credits to the creators of the word list in the `showCredits()` function!

Check Github for word lists on different languages, like [Hugo0's Wordle repo](https://github.com/Hugo0/wordle)
